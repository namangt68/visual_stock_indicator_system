1) "#help" or any message starting with "#" and containing help in it: The response to such an SMS will be simply a reply containing instructions on how to send an SMS. State of the VSIS system won't change bcos of this (i.e. no LED change color and no upload entry)
2) "#<valid HC name>1<anything here>": Will turn the corresponding HC's LED green indicating Stock OK
3) "#<valid HC name>0<stock info>":

Invalid SMSes:

2) Wrong HC name: A reply SMS is sent asking to send correct HC name
3) 5th character not 0 or 1 (when it is not a help msg): A reply SMS is sent asking to send 0 or 1 at 5th place
4) #<HC code>0<Stock Info>: Stock Info MUST be like this: Stock code followed by quantiy. This can be repeated any number of times. e.g.
