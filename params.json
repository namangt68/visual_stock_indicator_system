The code's explanation can be found in the file itself. This file is responsible to receive SMS, process them and take necessary actions like changing LED colours, sending feedback SMS to healthworker. This also saves the SMS request in file \"records\".<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namangt68/visual_stock_indicator_system/master/images/led.jpg\" align=\"right\"  alt=\"led\" width=\"300\" height=\"270\">\r\n\r\nAnother main script, `phantLoggerGSM.py` which runs at night time and uploads all the new entries received during the day which are saved in \"records\" file. The explanations for this file can also be found in that file only.\r\n\r\n#####LED indicators\r\nIn the initial prototype, green is a\r\nnormal indication. Red indicates an\r\nunanswered stock shortage and\r\nrequest, and yellow indicates that the\r\norder is available at the CHC. When the\r\nstatus of a sub-center is changed to\r\nyellow, an automated SMS will be sent\r\nto update the sub-center worker.\r\n\r\n####Usage <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namangt68/visual_stock_indicator_system/master/images/sms.png\" align=\"right\" alt=\"sms\" height=\"350\">\r\n##### Through direct SMS\r\nThe pattern in which the Health workers will send SMS for stock indication is:\r\nKamand ID: 0\r\n- #kam1\t- \tStock OK in Kamand\r\n- #kam0 p108 a377z52\t-\tStock problem exists in Kamand\r\nand Stock requested is: \r\n - paracetamol: 108 units\r\n - acetaminophen: 377 units\r\n - zincSulphate: 52 units\r\n\r\n`Other sms patterns like help are mentioned in code`\r\n#####Through App \r\n######App Features \r\n- Instant Stock Status.<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namangt68/visual_stock_indicator_system/master/images/app_net.png\" align=\"right\" alt=\"app\" height=\"350\">\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namangt68/visual_stock_indicator_system/master/images/app_upload.png\" align=\"right\" alt=\"app\" height=\"350\">\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namangt68/visual_stock_indicator_system/master/images/app_sms.png\" align=\"right\" alt=\"app\" height=\"350\">\r\n- Quick feedback on SMSs.\r\n- Data synchronized on cloud.\r\n- Easy to use Data frontend.\r\n- Android app with both quick SMS or net upload.\r\n\r\n([Download Android App)](https://github.com/namangt68/visual_stock_indicator_system/raw/master/AndroidApp/MedRestock.apk)\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n##### Medical Stock Data Frontend\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namangt68/visual_stock_indicator_system/master/images/frontend.png\" alt=\"frontend\">\r\n\r\n####Project Benefits\r\n\r\n- Accurate medical stock status at grassroot level.\r\n- Saves Health workers time.\r\n- Stock Maintenance in efficient and organized way.\r\n- Easily Extensible for higher levels.\r\n- Usability in technical limitations.\r\n- Easy to use e.g just SMS #kam0 p.\r\n\r\n####License\r\n\r\n[Apache-2.0 License](LICENSE).",
